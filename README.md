# Node.js & MySQL

## Overview

The project involves creating an Amazon type storefront with Node.js and MySQL. Consumers will be provided with a table of products on sale to choose from. They will be asked the item ID and quantity of the product they wish to purchase. If the inventory has enough of the product in stock, the order will be processed and the total purchase amount will be provided to the consumer and inventory of the products will be updated of the purchase.
